From the root directory of the ockam codebase:

## Base

- This image has things all container images will need - entrypoint, locales, curl.
- It is based on a lightweight version of [Debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian).
- It has no build tools.
- It is designed to be the base of images that are running in production and donâ€™t need build tools.

Build the base:

```
docker build \
  --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=debian:11.1-slim@sha256:312218c8dae688bae4e9d12926704fa9af6f7307a6edb4f66e479702a9af5a0c \
  --tag ockam-base:latest \
  --tag ghcr.io/build-trust/ockam-base:latest \
  tools/docker/base
```

## Builder Base

- This image uses the same dockerfile as `ockam-base`.
- It uses a base image of gcc which pulls in most build tools.
- This image is intended for any image that needs a compiler etc.

Build the base_builder:

```
docker build \
  --build-arg BASE_IMAGE=gcc:11.2.0@sha256:04582e63d008aaca294965f075669226f5f74d744f38904f1ad0f00a9590a6e0 \
  --tag ockam-builder-base:latest \
  --tag ghcr.io/build-trust/ockam-builder-base:latest \
  tools/docker/base
```

## Builder

- This image is based on ockam-builder-base and installs the actual tools needed to build the `/ockam` code base.

Build the builder:

```
docker build \
  --tag ockam-builder:latest \
  --tag ghcr.io/build-trust/ockam-builder:latest \
  tools/docker/builder
```

Run the builder:

```
docker run --rm -it -e HOST_USER_ID=$(id -u) --volume $(pwd):/work ockam-builder:latest bash
```

## Cloud node

```
docker build \
  --tag ockam-cloud-node:latest \
  --tag ghcr.io/build-trust/ockam-cloud-node:latest \
  --file tools/docker/cloud-node/Dockerfile .
```

Run the cloud node:

```
docker run --rm -it ockam-cloud-node:latest
```

## Verifying Ockam Images
All Ockam images are signed by [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign), you can verify our images using the commands below with our [public key](https://github.com/build-trust/ockam/blob/main/tools/docker/cosign.pub)

```bash
$ cat cosign.pub
