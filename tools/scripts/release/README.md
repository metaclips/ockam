# Ockam Scripts

This folder contains scripts to release Ockam Rust crates. Note, to run these scripts you need to run Bash version 4 upwards. All commands should be called from the Ockam root path.
To perform release, release scripts automatically check for updated crates using `recently created git tags`, we can override the default setting if want to track updated crates with a more recent tag. To specify a `git tag`, we can define a variable `GIT_TAG` to any of the scripts. For example to generate changelog using a more recent `git tag` we can call the following command below
```bash
GIT_TAG="a_more_recent_git_tag_v0.0.0" tools/scripts/release/changelog.sh
```
This is same for crate bump, crate publish and tagging scripts.

## Crate Bump

Crates versions are bumped using [cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/issues) >= v0.18.6. While bumping crates, CHANGELOG.md and README.md files are also updated with the bumped version.
To run crate bump, from the Ockam root path, call
```bash
RELEASE_VERSION=minor tools/scripts/release/crate-bump.sh
```
where RELEASE_VERSION is the [version](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/blob/master/docs/reference.md#bump-level) all crates are to be bumped to.

We can also indicate crates to follow a different release version, ignoring `RELEASE_VERSION`. To bump a crate to a different version, we indicate crates and the bumped version in `MODIFIED_RELEASE`
```bash
MODIFIED_RELEASE="signature_core:patch ockam_entity:major" RELEASE_VERSION=minor tools/scripts/release/crate-bump.sh
```
this bumps `signature_core` as a `patch`, `ockam_entity` as `major` and every other crate as `minor`.

If we indicate `RELEASE_VERSION` as a [release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release/blob/master/docs/reference.md#bump-level)
```bash
MODIFIED_RELEASE="signature_core:patch ockam_entity:major" RELEASE_VERSION=release tools/scripts/release/crate-bump.sh
```
only signature_core and ockam_entity crates are bumped.


## Changelog Generation

Changelogs are generated using [git-cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff). To generate changelogs, we call the [changelog.sh script](https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/blob/develop/tools/scripts/release/changelog.sh) which will generate changelogs and append to their CHANGELOG.md file.
To run changelog generator, from the Ockam root path, call
```bash
tools/scripts/release/changelog.sh
```
Generated changelogs should be reviewed and then committed.
Note, changelog generator should be called after crates and its dependencies have been bumped.


## Crate Publish

Crates are published to `crates.io` using [cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) right after bump. Only crates that have been updated (comparing `git diff` with last git tag) are published. Crates can also be excluded from being published using the `EXCLUDE_CRATES` variable, to exclude crates, we can optionally specify crates that are to be excluded `EXCLUDE_CRATES="signature_core ockam_core"`, where `signature_core` and `ockam_core` are excluded.

To publish crates
```bash
PUBLISH_TOKEN=my_crates.io_token EXCLUDE_CRATES="signature_core ockam_core" tools/scripts/release/crate-publish.sh
```
Note: Require cargo-release >= version 0.18.6

## Tagging

We perform tag release using [gh cli](https://cli.github.com) and [tomlq](https://github.com/jamesmunns/tomlq), a toml processor. A commit SHA is provided which all bumped crates are git tagged against.
To perform `git tag`
```bash
COMMIT_SHA=000000000 tools/scripts/release/tagging.sh
```

We can also only tag a single crate using the below command which only tags the Ockam crate
```bash
TAG_SINGLE_CRATE=ockam COMMIT_SHA=000000000 tools/scripts/release/tagging.sh
```

## Manual Release

For a manual release to be done, we should

- Generate Changelogs
- Bump Crates
- Publish Crates
- Tag Crates
