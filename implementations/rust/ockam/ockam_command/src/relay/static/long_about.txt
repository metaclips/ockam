Communication topologies often encounter situations where the machine providing a service cannot or will not open a listening port or expose a bridge node to other networks. This is a common security best practice in enterprise environments, home networks, OT networks, and VPCs across clouds. Application developers may not have control over these choices from the infrastructure/operations layer. In such cases, relays are useful.

Relays make it possible to establish end-to-end protocols with services operating in a remote private networks, without requiring a remote service to expose listening ports to an outside hostile network like the Internet.
